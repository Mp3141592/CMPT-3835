### PROJECT TITLE: Client Churn

Welcome to the repository for our Work Integrated 2 Project. The purpose of this project is to train a model to predict
whether or not a client will return based off the given features.

### Problem Statement

How can we learn if a client will return or not within a given period of time?

### Solution

We propose making a machine learning model that can predict whether or not a client will return based off key features taken from 
the merged datasets. To do so, we used an extreme gradient boost model (XGB). 

### Repository Structure

The repository contains the following files:

<p>finalfile.csv: Encoded file containing information.</p>
<p>app.py: A streamlit app programmed using python to allow users to make predictions with the model. Includes a chatbot to give insight into the data itself and
graphs to help explain the choices made by the model and team.</p>
<p>requirements.txt: Contains the libraries needed to run the jypter file and app.</p>
<p>Graphs: Folder containing a feature importance plot and a waterfall graph for predictions.</p>
<p>README.md: The file you are currently reading to learn about the project.</p>
<p>Work_Integrated_2_Project: Notebook containing most of the teams work (EDA, cleaning, processing, modeling, etc).</p>
<p>chatbot_chunks(various): Files used by the chatbot to work properly.</p>
<p>client_retention_model: The model created off of training data.</p>

### Getting Started

To get started with our project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. The dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file.

Alternatively, open the notebook in google colab.
